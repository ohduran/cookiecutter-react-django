Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), Cookiecutter React Django combines the capabilities of Django as a backend service with the flexibility and ease of use of React into the least opinionated framework possible that allows you to jumpstart a production-ready web application.

## Local setup

Let's assume that you want to create a project called "hello_world", one that makes a separation between a React-based front end and a Django-based backend, all set up locally using Docker and production ready in Heroku.

Most tutorials will give you a partial solution, so the only way is painstakingly piecing it together from multiple guides/tutorials that did some aspect of what you want without covering the whole.

> Side projects don't exactly require optimal productivity, but, unlike jobs, if they become a pain to work on, it's pretty easy to just quit.

Instead, we can do as follows. First, get Cookiecutter:

```$ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0" ```

Now run it against this repo:

```$ cookiecutter https://github.com/ohduran/cookiecutter-react-django```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then the project will be created for you.

Now, on your terminal, simply do `docker-compose up --build`, and wait for the containers to build. Eventually, you'll be able to see the index page by going to [`http://127.0.0.1/`](http://127.0.0.1/):

You will be able to see the following:

Write something on that box over there, it will get you the number of characters via your Django API!

## Usage

###### This project is based on a series of tutorials written by [Craig Franklin](https://github.com/cfranklin11) called [Creating an app with Docker Compose, Django, and Create React App](https://dev.to/englishcraig/creating-an-app-with-docker-compose-django-and-create-react-app-31lf).

### Deploy to Heroku

If you're new to Heroku, their [getting started guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) will walk you through the basics of creating a generic, non-dockerized Python app. If you don’t have it yet, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up).

1. We can create a Heroku app by running ```heroku create``` within our project. Once you've done it, Heroku will provide you with the following message:

    ```
    Creating app... done, ⬢ one-example-12345
    https://one-example-12345.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/one-example-12345.git
    ```

    In this case, ```one-example-12345``` is the name of the app; yours is likely to be different.

2. Make sure you link the Heroku app with your repository by running ```heroku git:remote -a [app name]```.

3. For environment variables in production, you can set the config variables by running the following command:

    ```
    heroku config:set PRODUCTION_HOST=[app name].herokuapp.com SECRET_KEY=[your secret key] DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=backend.settings.production
    ```

    You can generate a valid Django Secret Key via [this link](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/). REMEMBER to put the key between apostrophes ('), or you will likely get a `-bash: ****: event not found`

4. Now run ```heroku stack:set container``` to tell our Heroku app to use Docker.

5. At this point, you're ready to deploy: run ```git push heroku master```.

6. Checkout https://[app name].herokuapp.com. You should be able to see your web app ready!
